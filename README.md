# Scaling Hope
Training low-income single mothers to become AWS Certified Solutions Architects

## About This Repository
This is the curriculum repository for Scaling Hope training materials.

## Goal
The goal of the repository is to create a file for each FAQ page available on Amazon's website regarding Amazon Web Services. The FAQ will be used as the basis for study materials aimed at passing the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam. 

## Contributing Guidelines
We need help with collecting the content for study materials and creating situational multiple choice questions for practice exams. Our goal is to collect 1000 sample test questions that can randomly assembled into practice exams for our participants.

### How To Contribute
1. Copy and past any page from the AWS FAQ and create a new file in this repositry with the name of the subject matter. For example **S3.md** represents the FAQ of the S3 service on AWS. 
2. Create a test question file that will contain test questions for a specific subject. For example, **S3_test.md** will contain all our practice test questions for the questions related to the S3 service on AWS.
