# Scaling Hope Curriculum
Training low-income single mothers to become AWS Certified Solutions Architects. We are building an 8 month long program of self study and two 5 hour classroom sessions per month. The goal of the 8 months is to certify 1 cohort of 10-20 single mothers as AWS Solutions Architect Associates. 

## About This Repository
This is the curriculum repository for Scaling Hope training materials. 

## Goal
The goal of the repository is to create a file for each FAQ page available on Amazon's website regarding Amazon Web Services. The FAQ will be used as the basis for study materials aimed at passing the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam. 

## Contributing Guidelines
We need help with collecting the content for study materials and creating situational multiple choice questions for practice exams. Our goal is to collect 1000 sample test questions that can randomly assembled into practice exams for our participants.

### How To Contribute
1. Copy and past any page from the AWS FAQ and create a new file in this repositry with the name of the subject matter. For example **S3.md** represents the FAQ of the S3 service on AWS. 

2. Create a test question file that will contain test questions for a specific subject. For example, **S3_test.md** will contain all our practice test questions for the questions related to the S3 service on AWS.

3. Create a walkthrough file that will guide someone through using a particular service via the AWS Console. For example, **s3_console.md** will contain all the UI walkthroughs that one might need in order to execute architecture on S3 via the AWS console.

4. 3. Create a walkthrough file that will guide someone through using a particular service via the AWS Mobile App. For example, **s3_mobile.md** will contain all the UI walkthroughs that one might need in order to execute architecture on S3 via the AWS mobile app.

## Future Curriculum
Once the curriculum described above is completed, we will need to create more detailed curriculum to provide materials to our certified graduates to support them in getting the "Proffessional" certification. The more certifications we can support, the more opportunity our graduates will have to advance their careers and improve their lives.
